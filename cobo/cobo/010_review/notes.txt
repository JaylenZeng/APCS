time spent: 

1) 
    a) public static double sentimentVal( String word )
    b) Yes, this method requires you to input a String. If you pass a different type of parameter, it returns 0. 
    c) Yes the method returns a value. The return type is "double"

2) 
    METHOD CALL | RETURN value
    abandoned     -0.09
    corner        -0.06
    Timmy          0

3) 
    a) Yes, this statement would compile because the parameter is a string and there are no other errors.
    b) No, this statement would not compile because the paramater passed, 0.5, is a double and not a String. 
    c) No, this statement would not compile because sentimentVal only takes one parameter. This statement passes two.

HW36: All Quacked Up
ThinkJava Appendix D:
Compile-time errors: indicates something si wrong with the syntax (C)
Run-time errors: produced if something goes wrong while program is running (R)
Logic errors: causes program to do wrong thing (L)

(C)
-Usually only first error message is helpful.
-Go through each error message at a time.
-Sometimes error will be prior to location or somewhere else entirely
-Make sure you are compiling the correct file.
-Don't let compiler lead you astray. Use the existence of errors to recognize the problem and then solve it through your own willpower. Not always wise to listen to the advice of the compiler.

(R)
-When a program stops and does nothing, it is "hanging"
-Usually caused by infinite loops/recursion
-Also caused by exceptions in certain code like being out of range in an array.
-Simplify output for more effective debugging

(L)
-Logic errors are hard to find because no information is given
-Make connections between code and behavior.
-Once your conclusions contract output of code, you found the error!
